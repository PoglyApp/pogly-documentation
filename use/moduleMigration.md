## Updating Your Browser Source

Since the subdomain has changed, youâ€™ll need to update your browser source URL in your streaming tool:

- Change `standalone` â†’ `cloud` in the URL.
- If you renamed your module, update `?module=OLD_NAME` â†’ `?module=NEW_NAME`.

## What Happens to the Old Module?

You can leave your **old module** as it is, it will be automatically removed in the future.  
If youâ€™d like, you can continue using it temporarily, but we recommend migrating as soon as possible.
